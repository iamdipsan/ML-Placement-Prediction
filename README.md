# Machine Learning Demo

This project is designed to provide a simple demonstration of how machine learning works using the MLDLC, focusing on the basic steps involved in building and training a machine learning model. The goal is to understand the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project walks through the process of building a basic machine learning model, from loading and preparing data to training a model and making predictions.
