# Machine Learning Demo

This project is designed to provide a simple demonstration of how machine learning works using the MLDLC, focusing on the basic steps involved in building and training a machine learning model. The goal is to understand the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
This project helps to predict wether students with certain cgpa and iq will have placements  or not.
